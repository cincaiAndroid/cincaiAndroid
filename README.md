# cincaiAndroid ROM

This is an ambitious custom ROM project started by DenisMM @dmm.
An Android fork based on LineageOS & crDroid, developed at a slow pace with humility, sarcasm, and the occasional rage against jack-server.

### Goal: cincaiAndroid will eventually mature into a STABLE release, ready to be shared with custom Android enthusiasts.

🎯 Objectives

Build a lean and light Android system

Deliver an Android version in Kadazan language

## 🌱 The CincaiAndroid Vision

Smartphones today are treated like disposable lighters — two years, then into the trash.
OEMs spend millions maintaining bloated Android forks, while communities like LineageOS and XDA already have the talent and passion to keep devices alive.

Our proposal is simple:

📂 OEMs donate device sources and binary blobs.

🛠️ LineageOS/XDA maintain the updates.

💸 OEMs chip in a small yearly fee (less than the cost of one Times Square billboard) to fund OTA servers and infrastructure.

Result: OEMs save millions, Lineage gains stable funding, users enjoy 5–7 years of updates, and the planet sees less e-waste. Everyone wins.

⚡ Awareness: Device Lifespan

When you buy a phone, you’re not just buying hardware — you’re buying into an update cycle.

⏳ Without Custom ROMs

2–3 years of updates (if you’re lucky)

Security patches slow down or stop

Apps begin to fail due to outdated APIs

Device feels “forced obsolete” → ends up in a drawer or landfill

🔧 With Custom ROMs

5–7 years of usable life (sometimes 10+ if the community is strong)

Security patches continue via community maintainers

Performance tweaks + debloated software keep the phone smooth

Users have choice: stock UI with vendor bloat or clean lightweight builds like Lineage/Cincai
